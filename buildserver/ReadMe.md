# The build folder

in this folder you'll find the files to compile the sources in docker

### --- git ---

This folder contains the build scripts for linux or windows to pull the sources from git and compiles them.

Execute docker-build and it will run the compile for everything.

In case you need to update a specific server part, execute the appropriate docker-build file.

If you like to use any other mare fork, feel free to change the Dockerfiles.

### --- local ---

If you want to compile your own sources, that's the right folder for you.

Please read the notes in the sourcefiles folder.

The folder structure is important.
